# Crosswords Nomenclature

## Cell

A cell is a single square in a crossword grid. It can either be filled in or it's a dead cell.

## Dead Cell

A dead cell is a cell that cannot be filled in. It is traditionally drawn in black.

## Direction

Eg. `across`.

A direction is a way in which a word can be placed in a crossword grid. It can be either horizontal or vertical, called `across` and `down` respectively.

## Spots

A spot is a number that appears in a cell. It is used to indicate the start of a word in a crossword grid.

## Path

A path is a sequence of cells that form a word/phrase in a crossword grid.

## Answer

The answer is the word/phrase that fits in a path.

## Clue

A clue is a hint that helps the solver find the answer to a word/phrase in a crossword grid.

## Coord (Coordinate)

Eg. `2-1`.

A coord is a pair of numbers that represent the row and column of a cell in a crossword grid. The first number is the row and the second number is the column.

These appear only in code, so they are 0-indexed.
